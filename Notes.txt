REST Assured

Notes #------------------------

1. We execute the setup file first since it has the @BeforeClass tag
2. You can override parameters in the config within the tests
    Ex: .contentType() in the test body

Best Practices #------------------------

1. Use a baseClass setup to configure things to run before the test executes (ex: TestConfig.java -> setup())

Questions  #------------------------

Q1. What is the given, when & then ?
> Syntatic sugar which creates allows us to create our testcases like stories
> Given this ... When this ... Then do this ...

Given - Scenario Setup
          - Configuration
          - Headers
          - Parameters

WHEN  - Do some action
        - GET an endpoint
        - POST an endpoint

THEN  - Assertions
        - Check response code
        - Extract Data

Q2. What is the requestSpecification ? Why do we need it ?
> This specifies the headers. When you execute you should see this in the request:
Path params:	<none>
Headers:		Accept=application/json
				Content-Type=application/json
Cookies:		<none>

Q2a. Why do we need it ?
- The "Content-Type=application/json" -  sets the content type of the response we get back.
  In this case, we get back a json.
- Try setting it to xml and you should the response is to xml


Q3. What is the request Specifications ?
> Actions  to include in EVERY HTTP request
Ex: Headers, Cookies, Form Parameters, BASE URL

Q4. What are Response Specifications ?
> Actions to take AFTER every HTTP request
Ex: Check status code, Check content type, Response Time, Check headers

Q5. What are HTTP Request ?
- GET: Retrieve data from an endpoint
- POST: Send data to an endpoint
- PUT: Update a resource
- DELETE: Delete a resource

  C    R    U    D
POST  GET  PUT  DELETE

Q6. What is a path parameter ?
Ex: www.helloworld.com/videogame/{videoGameId}
- The {videoGameId} is the path parameter
- Path parameter replace the {xyz} into an a value

Q7. How to extract the whole JSON response body ?
- Use extract().response()


Q8. What is serialization ?
- Converts an object to JSON
- We take the object in form then use a POST request
to put the object in the body
Ex:
    public void testVideoGameSerializationByJson() {
        // Create an object
        VideoGame videoGame = new VideoGame("Shooter", "Virtual Cop", "Mature", "Nov3", 100);

        given()
                .body(videoGame)
        .when()
                .post(VideoGameEndpoints.ALL_VIDEO_GAMES)
        .then();
    }

Q9. What is Schema ?
Q10. What is XSD  file ?
Q11. How do we use Schema to test ?
Q12. What is Gpath ?
Q13. What is 'it' in Gpath ?
