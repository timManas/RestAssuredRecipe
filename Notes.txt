Notes #------------------------

1. We execute the setup file first since it has the @BeforeClass tag


Best Practices #------------------------

1. Use a baseClass setup to configure things to run before the test executes (ex: TestConfig.java -> setup())

Questions  #------------------------

Q1. What is the given, when & then ?
> Syntatic sugar which creates allows us to create our testcases like stories
> Given this ... When this ... Then do this ...

Given - Scenario Setup
          - Configuration
          - Headers
          - Parameters

WHEN  - Do some action
        - GET an endpoint

> This specifies the headers. When you execute you should see this in the request:
Path params:	<none>
Headers:		Accept=application/json

Q2a. Why do we need it ?
- The "Content-Type=application/json" -  sets the content type of the response we get back.
  In this case, we get back a json.
- Try setting it to xml and you should the response is to xml
